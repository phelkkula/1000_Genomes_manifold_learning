# Manifold learning of 1000 Genomes samples
#### Manifolds using different dimensionality reduction methods 

This repository provides examples for learning manifolds of the 1000 Genomes genotypes using various dimensionality reduction techniques. Plots of the two-dimensional manifolds are in the _plots_ 
folder. At the moment, this repository has examples using the following methods:

1.  Principal Components

2.  Multidimnesional scaling

3.  Spectral Embedding

4.  t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding

5.  Variational Autoencoder (implementation with Keras)
